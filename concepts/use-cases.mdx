## Integration Examples

### Web Application Integration

```javascript
// Express.js server with Paycrest integration
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

// Webhook signature verification
function verifySignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(JSON.stringify(payload))
    .digest('hex');
  return signature === hash;
}

// Webhook endpoint for order updates
app.post('/webhooks/paycrest', async (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.get('X-Paycrest-Signature');
  
  if (!verifySignature(req.body, signature, process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET)) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }
  
  const { event, orderId, status, data } = req.body;
  
  try {
    // Update order status in database
    await updateOrderStatus(orderId, status);
    
    // Send notification to user based on status
    if (status === 'settled') {
      await notifyUserSuccess(orderId, data);
    } else if (status === 'expired') {
      await notifyUserExpired(orderId);
    }
    
    res.status(200).send('Webhook processed');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook processing error:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Internal server error');
  }
});

// API endpoint to create payment order

// Direct API integration using fetch
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.paycrest.io/v1';
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

const initiatePayment = async (amount, recipient) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/orders`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'API-Key': API_KEY
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: amount.toString(),
    token: 'USDT',
    network: 'base',
    recipient: recipient,
    reference: `mobile-payment-${Date.now()}`
  })
});

if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`API request failed: ${response.statusText}`);
}

const order = await response.json();
    
    // Show payment instructions to user
    showPaymentInstructions(order.receiveAddress, order.validUntil);
    
    // Start polling for status updates
    pollOrderStatus(order.id);
    
    return order;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Payment initiation failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

const pollOrderStatus = async (orderId) => {
  const checkStatus = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/orders/${orderId}`, {
  headers: {
    'API-Key': API_KEY
  }
});

if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`Status check failed: ${response.statusText}`);
}

const orderData = await response.json();
const status = orderData.status;
      
      if (status === 'settled') {
        showSuccessMessage('Payment completed successfully!');
        stopPolling();

      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Status check failed:', error);
    }
  };
  
  // Poll every 10 seconds
  const interval = setInterval(checkStatus, 10000);
  
  // Stop polling after 5 minutes
  setTimeout(() => {
    clearInterval(interval);
  }, 300000);
};
```
