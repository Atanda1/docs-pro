Understanding the complete lifecycle of a payment order in the Paycrest protocol is crucial for building reliable integrations. This section explains each stage of the order processing flow and what happens at each step.

## Overview

A payment order in the Paycrest protocol follows a well-defined lifecycle from order creation to final settlement. Each stage has specific requirements, validations, and outcomes that ensure reliable and compliant order routing and fulfillment.

## Transaction Stages

### 1. Order Creation

The transaction lifecycle begins when a sender creates a payment order.

#### Order Parameters

**Required Fields:**
- **Amount**: Transaction amount in stablecoins
- **Token**: Stablecoin type (USDT, USDC, etc.)
- **Network**: Blockchain network (Base, Polygon, etc.)
- **Recipient**: Bank account or wallet details
- **Reference**: Unique transaction identifier

**Optional Fields:**
- **Rate**: Exchange rate (if not using market rate)
- **Memo**: Payment purpose/narration
- **Return Address**: Address for refunds if needed

#### Validation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Parameter Validation">
    Validate all required fields are present and properly formatted
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sender Verification">
    Verify sender KYC status and account validity
  </Step>
  <Step title="Recipient Validation">
    Validate recipient information and delivery method
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compliance Check">
    Perform AML/CFT screening and risk assessment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rate Calculation">

- **`validated`**: Order validated and ready for settlement
- **`settled`**: Order fully completed on blockchain
- **`expired`**: Order expired because no transfer was made to the receive address within the time limit

### 2. Provider Assignment

Once an order is created, aggregators work to assign it to suitable providers.

#### Assignment Criteria

**Provider Selection Factors:**
- **Geographic Coverage**: Provider supports recipient location
