# Compliance & Security

Paycrest protocol is in an early stage and is designed with a focus on responsible practices, but it is not a regulated financial service. The protocol is open, evolving, and may change as the ecosystem matures.

## Compliance Approach

### KYC/KYB Requirements

All participants in the Paycrest protocol must complete Know Your Customer (KYC) or Know Your Business (KYB) verification:

- **Senders**: Individual or business verification required
- **Providers**: Business verification and licensing requirements
- **Aggregators**: Business verification and compliance oversight

### Regulatory Considerations

- **Local Compliance**: Participants must comply with local regulations
- **Cross-Border**: International transfer regulations apply
- **AML/CFT**: Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing requirements
- **Data Protection**: GDPR and local privacy law compliance

## Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

- **Audited Contracts**: All Gateway contracts undergo security audits
- **Multi-Signature**: Critical operations require multi-signature approval
- **Timelock Mechanisms**: Protocol upgrades have built-in delays
- **Emergency Pause**: Ability to pause operations in security incidents

### Infrastructure Security

- **High Availability**: Redundant infrastructure for reliability
- **DDoS Protection**: Protection against distributed denial of service attacks
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, authentication, and encryption
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest

  Paycrest protocol is not a licensed financial institution. This documentation does not constitute legal or regulatory advice. Compliance requirements and security practices may change as the protocol evolves.
