# Protocol Participants

The Paycrest protocol ecosystem consists of four main participant types, each with specific roles and responsibilities. Understanding these participants is crucial for building on the protocol.

## Sender

A **KYC-verified entity** that initiates either a fiat-to-stablecoin or stablecoin-to-fiat transaction.

### Characteristics

- **KYC Required**: Must complete identity verification (KYC/KYB)
- **API Access**: Uses the Sender API to create orders or can interact directly with the Gateway contract
- **Fee Structure**: Zero transaction fees (all sender fees are paid by providers)
- **Flexibility**: Can be smart contracts, dApps, or traditional applications

### Responsibilities

- **Order Creation**: Specify amount, token, recipient, and rate
- **Recipient Information**: Provide accurate bank account or wallet details
- **Compliance**: Maintain KYC status and regulatory compliance
- **Monitoring**: Track order status and handle webhooks

### Use Cases

- **Remittance Services**: Send money to family abroad
- **Business Payments**: Pay suppliers in different currencies
- **DeFi Applications**: Bridge between crypto and traditional finance
- **E-commerce**: Accept crypto payments and settle in fiat

## Recipient

The **beneficiary** of the transaction who receives funds without interacting with the protocol directly.

### Characteristics

- **Passive Role**: No direct protocol interaction required
- **Multiple Options**: Can receive fiat or stablecoins
- **Flexible Delivery**: Bank accounts, mobile wallets, or crypto wallets
- **Zero Complexity**: Doesn't need to understand blockchain technology

### Delivery Methods

- **Bank Transfer**: Direct deposit to local bank account
- **Mobile**: Transfer to mobile wallet (M-Pesa, etc.) or mobile payment systems (UPI, PIX)

> **Note:** Cash pickup is not supported. All off-ramps are to fiat accounts or wallets.

### Example Scenarios

- **Family Remittance**: Receive USD in local bank account
- **Freelancer Payment**: Get paid in local currency for crypto work
- **Business Settlement**: Receive supplier payments in preferred currency
- **Investment Returns**: Convert crypto gains to fiat

## Provider

A **KYC-verified participant** that supplies fiat liquidity in exchange for stablecoins or provides stablecoins in exchange for fiat.

### Characteristics

- **Liquidity Supply**: Provides fiat or crypto liquidity
- **KYC/KYB Required**: Business verification for compliance
- **PSP Integration**: Connects to Payment Service Providers
- **Competitive Rates**: Sets rates based on market conditions

### Responsibilities

- **Order Fulfillment**: Execute payments to recipients
- **Rate Management**: Set competitive rates for currency pairs
- **Compliance**: Maintain regulatory compliance and reporting
- **Infrastructure**: Operate reliable payment infrastructure

### Revenue Model

- **Bid-Ask Spreads**: Profit from currency exchange spreads

## Aggregator

A **KYC-verified entity** that coordinates the entire payment process and ensures protocol efficiency.

### Characteristics

- **Order Matching**: Matches orders with suitable providers
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures reliable order fulfillment
- **Compliance Oversight**: Manages KYC and regulatory compliance
