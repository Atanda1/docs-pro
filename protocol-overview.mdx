# Protocol Overview

The Paycrest Protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol designed to bridge the gap between digital assets and real-world financial systems. This overview covers the core architecture, participants, and key components.

## Protocol Vision

Paycrest exists to solve the fundamental problems with cross-border payments in emerging markets:

- **High costs** from legacy intermediaries and fragmented liquidity
- **Slow settlement** due to closed banking networks
- **Poor user experience** with complex compliance requirements
- **Limited accessibility** for underbanked populations

Our solution enables **near-instant fiat/stablecoin conversion** via a decentralized network of KYC-verified Providers, with **zero transaction fees for senders** and **embedded compliance** through user-friendly flows.

## Core Architecture

The Paycrest Protocol consists of several key components working together:

### 1. Gateway Smart Contract

The core multi-chain contract deployed on fast EVM-compatible networks (e.g., Base, Arbitrum, Lisk). It manages:

- **Order creation** and validation
- **Token escrow** and conditional settlement
- **Fee distribution** and protocol governance
- **Multi-chain interoperability**

### 2. Paycrest Node

The unified protocol client that can operate in three modes:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Aggregator Mode">
    - Listens to onchain payment order events
    - Indexes registered Providers
    - Performs matching logic
    - Validates KYC data off-chain
    - Issues onchain attestations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provision Mode">
    - Registers liquidity parameters
    - Monitors order matching
    - Integrates with Payment Service Providers (PSPs)
    - Performs last-mile fiat delivery
    - Submits fulfillment proofs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hybrid Mode">
    - Operates as both Aggregator and Provider
    - Useful for participants with both capabilities
    - Optimizes for participants with full-stack operations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 3. Sender API & Webhooks

Interfaces that allow businesses and apps to:

- **Create payment orders** with operational settings
- **Configure refund addresses**, fee addresses, and fee percentages
- **Manage API keys** and authentication
- **Receive real-time updates** on status transitions
- **Handle webhook notifications** for order lifecycle events

### 4. KYC Attestation Registry

A registry of attestations for both Senders and Providers:

- **Onchain attestations** for identity verification
- **Off-chain verifiable credentials** support
- **Encrypted KYC data** stored on decentralized storage
- **Compliance integration** with regulatory requirements

## Protocol Participants

### Sender

A KYC-verified entity that initiates either a fiat-to-stablecoin or stablecoin-to-fiat transaction. This can be:

- **Smart contracts** or dApps
- **API clients** integrating with the protocol
- **EIP-4337 smart accounts** for advanced wallet functionality
- **Traditional applications** abstracting away blockchain complexity

The sender supplies the recipient's fiat account information and initiates the payment order.

### Recipient

The beneficiary of the transaction who receives:

- **Local fiat** in a bank account or mobile wallet
- **Stablecoins** in a crypto wallet

The recipient doesn't need to interact with the protocol directly - they simply receive the funds through their preferred method.

### Provider

A KYC-verified participant that supplies fiat liquidity in exchange for stablecoins or provides stablecoins in exchange for fiat. Providers:

- **Connect to the aggregator** and register rates and limits
- **Fulfill payment orders** (off-ramp or on-ramp)
- **Receive corresponding assets** post-validation
- **Integrate with Payment Service Providers (PSPs)** for last-mile delivery

### Aggregator

A KYC-verified entity that coordinates the entire payment process:

- **Listens to payment order events** from the Gateway contract
- **Matches orders** with suitable Providers
- **Coordinates fulfillment** and settlement
- **Performs off-chain KYC verification** for both Senders and Providers
- **Splits large orders** across multiple Providers
- **Issues onchain attestations** for compliance
- **Enforces penalties** for failed delivery

## Order Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Order Creation">
    Sender creates a payment order on the Gateway contract with recipient details, amount, and rate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Aggregation">
    Aggregator indexes the order and matches it with suitable Providers based on rates, limits, and availability.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provider Assignment">
    One or more Providers are assigned to fulfill the order, with the order potentially split across multiple Providers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fulfillment">
    Providers execute the payment through their PSP integrations, delivering fiat to the recipient.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    Aggregator validates the fulfillment and issues attestations onchain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Settlement">
    Smart contract releases escrowed stablecoins to Providers and settles all fees.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Multi-Chain Support

Paycrest is designed for multi-chain interoperability:

### Current Support

- **Ethereum L2s**: Base, Arbitrum, Optimism
- **Tron Network**: For USDT transactions
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: For high-value transactions

### Future Expansion

- **Modular chains**: App-specific rollups and Layer 3s
- **App-specific rollups**: Custom chains for specific use cases
- **Cross-chain bridges**: Seamless asset movement between chains

## Security & Compliance

### Smart Contract Security

- **Audited Gateway contracts** with escrow functionality
- **Multi-signature governance** for protocol upgrades
- **Timelock mechanisms** for critical parameter changes
- **Emergency pause functionality** for security incidents

### Compliance Integration

- **KYC/KYB verification** for all participants
- **Identity attestation registry** onchain
- **Regulatory reporting** capabilities
- **AML/CFT compliance** through integrated providers

### Privacy Protection

- **Encrypted recipient data** stored off-chain
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** for compliance verification
- **Selective disclosure** of sensitive information
- **GDPR compliance** for user data protection

## Fee Structure

The Paycrest Protocol implements a **zero-fee experience for senders**:

- **Sender fees**: 0% (borne by the protocol)
- **Provider fees**: Competitive rates based on market conditions
- **Protocol fees**: Minimal fees for network maintenance
- **Network fees**: Gas costs for blockchain transactions

Providers earn fees by:
- **Bid-ask spreads** on currency pairs
- **Volume-based incentives** for high-frequency providers
- **Quality bonuses** for reliable fulfillment
- **Geographic premiums** for underserved markets

## Governance

### Early Stage

In early stages, protocol changes are ratified by a **Paycrest Core Multisig**:

- **Founding contributors** and technical leads
- **Multi-signature requirements** for all changes
- **Transparent proposal process** with community input
- **Emergency procedures** for critical updates

### Future Decentralization

As the protocol matures, governance will transition to:

- **Community-led structure** with token-weighted voting
- **Delegate-based technical councils** for specialized decisions
- **Onchain governance** for parameter changes
- **Off-chain coordination** for complex upgrades

## Technical Specifications

### Smart Contracts

- **Gateway Contract**: Core order management and escrow

- **Governance Contracts**: Multi-signature and timelock mechanisms
- **Attestation Registry**: KYC and compliance verification

### API Standards

- **RESTful API** for all interactions
- **WebSocket support** for real-time updates

<Note>
  The Paycrest Protocol is designed to be both Web3-native and accessible to traditional financial applications. The modular architecture allows for different deployment models while maintaining the core benefits of decentralization.
