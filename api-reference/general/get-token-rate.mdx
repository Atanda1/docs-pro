title: 'Get Token Rate'
openapi: 'GET /rates/{token}/{amount}/{fiat}'
---

Get the rate for a token/amount/fiat combination. This endpoint returns the rate from the first available provider in the priority queue that can handle the specified token, amount, and currency combination.

## Parameters

- `token` (path, required): The token symbol (e.g., "USDC", "USDT")
- `amount` (path, required): The token amount to get the rate for
- `fiat` (path, required): The fiat currency code (e.g., "NGN", "KES")
- `network` (query, optional): The blockchain network identifier (e.g., "arbitrum-one", "polygon", "base"). If not provided, returns the first matching token across all networks.
- `provider_id` (query, optional): Specific provider ID to get their rate instead of the priority queue selection

## Example

```bash
# Get rate for USDC on Arbitrum One
GET /rates/USDC/100/NGN?network=arbitrum-one

# Get rate for USDC on any network (first match)
GET /rates/USDC/100/NGN

# Get rate from specific provider
GET /rates/USDC/100/NGN?provider_id=123&network=arbitrum-one
```

## Response

### Success Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Rate fetched successfully",
  "data": "1500.50"
}
```

### Error Responses

#### 400 Bad Request
- **Token not supported**: `"Token USDC is not supported"`
- **Token not supported on network**: `"Token USDC is not supported on network arbitrum-one"`
- **Fiat currency not supported**: `"Fiat currency XYZ is not supported"`
- **Invalid amount**: `"Invalid amount"`
- **Currency conversion not supported**: `"USDC can only be converted to USD"`
- **Provider not found**: `"Provider not found"`
- **Provider configuration error**: `"Provider does not support this token/currency combination"`
- **Amount out of range**: `"Amount must be between 10 and 1000 for this provider"`

#### 503 Service Unavailable
- **No provider available**: `"No provider available for USDC to NGN conversion with amount 100"`

## Rate Resolution Logic

The API uses the following logic to determine the rate:

1. **Direct Currency Match**: If the token's base currency matches the fiat currency, returns 1:1 rate
2. **Provider-Specific Rate**: If `provider_id` is provided, returns that provider's rate (if they support the combination)
3. **Priority Queue Selection**: Searches through provider buckets in priority order and returns the rate from the first provider that can handle the request
4. **Service Unavailable**: If no provider can handle the request, returns 503 error

## Priority Queue System

The current implementation uses a priority queue to determine provider selection:

- **Provider Order**: Providers are ranked by priority (highest priority first)
- **First Available Wins**: The first provider that meets all criteria gets selected
- **No Rate Comparison**: The system doesn't compare rates to find the "best" one - it uses the first suitable provider
- **Queue Randomization**: Provider order is randomized periodically to ensure fair distribution

<Note>
  The priority queue system is the current implementation and may change in future versions. Provider selection is based on priority order, not rate comparison.
</Note>

## Important Notes

- **Priority-Based Selection**: The API returns the rate from the first available provider in the priority queue, not necessarily the lowest or highest rate
- **No Market Rate Fallback**: The API does not fall back to market rates when no providers are available
- **Service Availability**: A 503 response indicates that no providers can currently handle your request
- **Amount Validation**: Providers have minimum and maximum order amounts that must be respected
- **Network Filtering**: Network filters are applied to both token selection and provider matching

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **503 Service Unavailable**: Try adjusting the amount or currency combination
2. **400 Bad Request - Amount out of range**: Check provider limits for your token/currency pair
3. **400 Bad Request - Provider not found**: Verify the provider ID is correct and active

### Best Practices

- Always handle 503 responses gracefully in your application
- Consider implementing retry logic with different amounts
- Cache successful rates to reduce API calls
- Monitor provider availability for your specific use cases
- Understand that rates are based on priority queue order, not rate comparison
