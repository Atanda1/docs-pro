# API Reference

Welcome to the Paycrest API Reference. Here you'll find detailed documentation for all available endpoints, including request/response formats, authentication, and integration tips.

- For a quick start, see the [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide.
- For OpenAPI playground, see the interactive API explorer below (if available).

The Paycrest Aggregator API provides a comprehensive interface for interacting with the Paycrest protocol. This API enables senders to create payment orders, providers to fulfill orders, and general access to protocol information.

## Base URL

```bash
# Production
https://api.paycrest.io/v1
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request header:

```bash
API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Getting Your API Key

1. **Register** at [app.paycrest.io](https://app.paycrest.io)
2. **Complete KYC verification** (required for compliance)
3. **Generate API credentials** in your dashboard
4. **Save your API key** securely

<Note>
  Your API key should be kept secure and never shared publicly. It's used to authenticate all API requests and identify your account.
</Note>

## API Endpoints

The Paycrest API is organized into three main categories:

### Sender Endpoints

For entities that create payment orders:

- **`POST /sender/orders`** - Create a new payment order
- **`GET /sender/orders`** - List payment orders with filtering
- **`GET /sender/orders/{id}`** - Get specific payment order details
- **`GET /sender/stats`** - Get sender statistics

### Provider Endpoints

For liquidity providers that fulfill orders:

- **`GET /provider/orders`** - List available orders for fulfillment
- **`POST /provider/orders/{id}/accept`** - Accept an order for fulfillment
- **`POST /provider/orders/{id}/decline`** - Decline an order
- **`POST /provider/orders/{id}/fulfill`** - Fulfill an order with payment details
- **`POST /provider/orders/{id}/cancel`** - Cancel an order with reason
- **`GET /provider/rates/{token}/{fiat}`** - Get market rates
- **`GET /provider/stats`** - Get provider statistics
- **`GET /provider/node-info`** - Get node information

### General Endpoints

For protocol information and utilities:

- **`GET /currencies`** - List supported fiat currencies
- **`GET /institutions/{currency_code}`** - List supported institutions
- **`GET /tokens`** - List supported tokens
- **`GET /rates/{token}/{amount}/{fiat}`** - Get token rates
- **`GET /pubkey`** - Get aggregator public key
- **`POST /verify-account`** - Verify bank account details
- **`GET /orders/{chain_id}/{id}`** - Get lock payment order status
- **`GET /reindex/{network}/{tx_hash}`** - Reindex transactions

## Request Format

All requests should include the following headers:

```bash
Content-Type: application/json
API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.paycrest.io/v1/sender/orders" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 100,
    "token": "USDT",
    "network": "base",
    "rate": 1.0,
    "recipient": {
      "institution": "GTB",
      "accountIdentifier": "1234567890",
      "accountName": "John Doe",
      "currency": "NGN",
      "memo": "Salary payment for January 2024"
    },
    "reference": "payment-123",
    "returnAddress": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
  }'
```

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  }
}
```

### Error Responses

Error responses include detailed information:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "data": [
    {
      "field": "amount",
      "message": "Amount must be greater than 0"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Senders**: 100 requests per minute
- **Providers**: 200 requests per minute
- **General endpoints**: 1000 requests per minute

Rate limit headers are included in responses:

```bash
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination with the following parameters:

- **`page`** - Page number (default: 1)
- **`pageSize`** - Items per page (default: 20, max: 100)

### Example

```bash
GET /sender/orders?page=2&pageSize=10
```

Response includes pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Orders retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "total": 150,
    "page": 2,
    "pageSize": 10,
    "orders": [...]
  }
}
```

## Webhooks

Set up webhooks to receive real-time updates:

### Webhook Events

- **`order.initiated`** - Order initiated via API (before Gateway creation)
- **`order.pending`** - Order awaiting provider assignment
- **`order.validated`** - Order validated and ready for settlement
- **`order.settled`** - Order settled on blockchain
- **`order.refunded`** - Order refunded to sender
- **`order.expired`** - Order expired because no transfer was made to the receive address within the time limit

### Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "event": "order.settled",
  "orderId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "status": "settled",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",

    "settlementAmount": "50000"
  }
}
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid API key |
| `403` | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource not found |

| `500` | Internal Server Error - Server error |

## Testing

### Sandbox Environment

For development and testing, use the sandbox environment:

- **Base URL**: `https://sandbox-api.paycrest.io/v1`
- **Test API Key**: `11f93de0-d304-4498-8b7b-6cecbc5b2dd8`
- **Low Minimum Orders**: Start with as little as $0.50

<Note>
  Paycrest supports very low minimum orders ($0.50) and uses cost-effective EVM L2s, making it perfect for testing with real transactions. Start small and scale up as you gain confidence.
</Note>
