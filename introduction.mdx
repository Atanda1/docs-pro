# Welcome to Paycrest

Paycrest is a **decentralized payment routing protocol** that democratizes global payments by enabling **instant**, secure, and **zero-fee** stablecoin-to-fiat and fiat-to-stablecoin exchange through a network of verified providers.

## Our Mission

> **"To accelerate the creation of democratized payment systems of the future"**

We believe that financial infrastructure should be accessible to everyone, everywhere. Paycrest is building the foundation for a more inclusive, transparent, and efficient global payment ecosystem where:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Universal Access" icon="users">
    **Anyone can participate** as a sender, provider, or developer
  </Card>
  <Card title="Decentralized Control" icon="building">
    **No central authority controls** the flow of funds
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built-in Security" icon="shield-check">
    **Transparency and security** are built into every transaction
  </Card>
  <Card title="Global Integration" icon="globe">
    **Local solutions** work seamlessly with global networks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This mission drives every aspect of our protocol design, from the decentralized architecture to the developer-friendly APIs.

## The Problem

Cross-border payments â€” especially in Africa and other emerging markets â€” remain globally expensive, slow, and fragmented. This is largely due to:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Legacy Infrastructure" icon="building">
    <ul>
      <li>Reliance on legacy intermediaries</li>
      <li>Closed banking networks</li>
      <li>Fragmented liquidity</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Compliance Bottlenecks" icon="shield">
    <ul>
      <li>Compliance bottlenecks</li>
      <li>Informal exchange networks</li>
      <li>Poor user experience</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Solution

Paycrest addresses these challenges by introducing a decentralized payment routing protocol that enables:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Instant Conversion" icon="clock">
    **Near-instant fiat/stablecoin conversion** via a decentralized network of Providers
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Zero Sender Fees" icon="coins">
    **Zero transaction fees for senders**, with protocol fees paid by Providers and optional sender fees for businesses
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Embedded Compliance" icon="shield-check">
    **Embedded compliance** through user-friendly KYC and attestation flows
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Crypto-Free UX" icon="user">
    **Streamlined crypto-free UX**, enabling adoption without requiring users to understand wallets or chains
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Multi-Chain Support" icon="link">
    **Multi-chain interoperability**, beginning with support for Ethereum L2s and expanding to modular chains
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Order">
    A sender creates a payment order on the Gateway Smart Contract, specifying the amount, token, recipient details, and rate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Aggregate">
    The aggregator node indexes the order and assigns it to one or more provision nodes run by liquidity providers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fulfill">
    The provisioning node automatically disburses funds to the recipient's local bank account or mobile wallet via connections to payment service providers (PSPs).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Performance**: Most orders complete in under 30 seconds, with automatic refunds if not completed within 5 minutes.
</Note>

## What is Paycrest?

Just as **SWIFT** operates as a financial messaging protocol without being a financial institution, **Paycrest** functions as a decentralized payment messaging protocol without being a payment processor. The Paycrest protocol doesn't hold funds, process payments, or act as a financial intermediary.

Instead, the protocol provides the **infrastructure and messaging layer** that enables:
- **Instant order routing** between senders and providers
- **Secure message transmission** with encrypted recipient data
- **Standardized payment instructions** across different currencies and networks
- **Compliance integration** with regulatory requirements

The key difference? Paycrest is **faster, cheaper, and onchain** - leveraging blockchain technology to eliminate the need for traditional banking intermediaries while maintaining the same reliability and security standards.

## Roadmap

Paycrest is evolving from a federated protocol to a fully decentralized, permissionless network. Here's what's live and what's coming next:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Current: Offramp Protocol">
    <ul>
      <li>Paycrest operates the only aggregator (federated model)</li>
      <li><strong>Providers pay protocol fees to the aggregator that assigned the order</strong></li>
      <li>Senders and providers must sign up and obtain API keys</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Q3 2025: Onramp Launch">
    Support for onramp (fiat-to-stablecoin) flows
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Onchain KYC (2025+)">
    <ul>
      <li>Shareable, reusable KYC credentials across all Paycrest-integrated apps</li>
      <li>Based on onchain identity standards</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Full Decentralization & P2P Networking">
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple aggregators, permissionless participation</li>
      <li>Unified Paycrest node: aggregator, provision, and hybrid modes</li>
      <li>Identities and communication via public key cryptography and P2P (e.g., libp2p)</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Currently, Paycrest operates a single aggregator. In the future, the protocol will support multiple aggregators and full decentralization. See the Roadmap above for details.
