# Welcome to Paycrest Protocol

Paycrest is a **decentralized liquidity protocol** that enables **fast**, **secure**, and **low-cost fiat-to-stablecoin and stablecoin-to-fiat exchange** using stablecoins and KYC-linked Providers.

## The Problem

Cross-border payments — especially in Africa and other emerging markets — remain globally expensive, slow, and fragmented. This is largely due to:

- Reliance on legacy intermediaries
- Closed banking networks  
- Compliance bottlenecks
- Fragmented liquidity
- Informal exchange networks
- Poor user experience

## The Solution

Paycrest addresses these challenges by introducing a decentralized liquidity protocol that enables:

- **Near-instant fiat/stablecoin conversion** via a decentralized network of Providers
- **Zero transaction fees for senders**, with protocol fees borne by Providers
- **Embedded compliance** through user-friendly KYC and attestation flows
- **Streamlined crypto-free UX**, enabling adoption without requiring users to understand wallets or chains
- **Multi-chain interoperability**, beginning with support for Ethereum L2s and expanding to modular chains

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Order">
    A sender creates a payment order on the Gateway Smart Contract, specifying the amount, token, recipient details, and rate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Aggregate">
    The aggregator node indexes the order and assigns it to one or more provision nodes run by liquidity providers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fulfill">
    The provisioning node automatically disburses funds to the recipient's local bank account or mobile wallet via connections to payment service providers (PSPs).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Participants

- **Sender**: KYC-verified entities that initiate fiat-to-stablecoin or stablecoin-to-fiat transactions
- **Recipient**: The beneficiary who receives local fiat or stablecoins without interacting with the protocol
- **Provider**: KYC-verified participants that supply fiat liquidity in exchange for stablecoins
- **Aggregator**: KYC-verified entities that match orders with suitable Providers and coordinate fulfillment

## Protocol Vision

Paycrest exists to bridge the gap between digital assets and real-world financial systems, especially in underbanked and high-friction economies. Our long-term vision includes:

- **Modular architecture**: Storage, KYC, and execution may occur across different chains and systems
- **Multi-chain support**: Beginning with Ethereum L2s and expanding to modular chains and app-specific rollups
- **Embedded compliance**: User-friendly KYC and attestation flows
- **Zero-fee experience**: Protocol fees borne by Providers, not senders
