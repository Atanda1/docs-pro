# Welcome to Paycrest

Paycrest is a **decentralized liquidity protocol** that enables **fast**, **secure**, and **low-cost fiat-to-stablecoin and stablecoin-to-fiat exchange** using stablecoins and KYC-linked Providers.

## The Problem

Cross-border payments — especially in Africa and other emerging markets — remain globally expensive, slow, and fragmented. This is largely due to:

- Reliance on legacy intermediaries
- Closed banking networks  
- Compliance bottlenecks
- Fragmented liquidity
- Informal exchange networks
- Poor user experience

## The Solution

Paycrest addresses these challenges by introducing a decentralized liquidity protocol that enables:

- **Near-instant fiat/stablecoin conversion** via a decentralized network of Providers
- **Zero transaction fees for senders**, with protocol fees borne by Providers
- **Embedded compliance** through user-friendly KYC and attestation flows
- **Streamlined crypto-free UX**, enabling adoption without requiring users to understand wallets or chains
- **Multi-chain interoperability**, beginning with support for Ethereum L2s and expanding to modular chains

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Order">
    A sender creates a payment order on the Gateway Smart Contract, specifying the amount, token, recipient details, and rate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Aggregate">
    The aggregator node indexes the order and assigns it to one or more provision nodes run by liquidity providers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fulfill">
    The provisioning node automatically disburses funds to the recipient's local bank account or mobile wallet via connections to payment service providers (PSPs).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Participants

- **Sender**: KYC-verified entities that initiate fiat-to-stablecoin or stablecoin-to-fiat transactions
- **Recipient**: The beneficiary who receives local fiat or stablecoins without interacting with the protocol
- **Provider**: KYC-verified participants that supply fiat liquidity in exchange for stablecoins
- **Aggregator**: KYC-verified entities that match orders with suitable Providers and coordinate fulfillment

## Protocol Vision

Paycrest exists to bridge the gap between digital assets and real-world financial systems, especially in underbanked and high-friction economies. Our long-term vision includes:

- **Modular architecture**: Storage, KYC, and execution may occur across different chains and systems
- **Multi-chain support**: Beginning with Ethereum L2s and expanding to modular chains and app-specific rollups
- **Embedded compliance**: User-friendly KYC and attestation flows
- **Zero-fee experience**: Protocol fees borne by Providers, not senders

## Roadmap

Paycrest is evolving from a federated protocol to a fully decentralized, permissionless network. Here's what's live and what's coming next:

### 1. **Current: Offramp Protocol**
- Paycrest operates the only aggregator (federated model).
- **Providers pay protocol fees to the aggregator that assigned the order.**
- Senders and providers must sign up and obtain API keys.

### 2. **Q3 2025: Onramp Launch**
- Support for onramp (fiat-to-stablecoin) flows.

### 3. **Onchain KYC (2025+)**
- Shareable, reusable KYC credentials across all Paycrest-integrated apps.
- Based on onchain identity standards.

### 4. **Full Decentralization & P2P Networking**
- Multiple aggregators, permissionless participation.
- Unified Paycrest node: aggregator, provision, and hybrid modes.
- Identities and communication via public key cryptography and P2P (e.g., libp2p).

<Note>
  Currently, Paycrest operates a single aggregator. In the future, the protocol will support multiple aggregators and full decentralization. See the Roadmap above for details.
